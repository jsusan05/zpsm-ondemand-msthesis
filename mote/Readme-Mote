/*Code changes for BaseStation_duty */
/************************************/
The following changes were added to the original BaseStation code to implement the duty cycle in mote
So that the radio is not ON always. it is ON for 20ms and OFF after that for 30ms. This happens periodically
The time interval was chosen as the wakeup interval is 40ms

Makefile
++++Added to change the channel that mote listens to
    PFLAGS += -DCC2420_DEF_CHANNEL=5

BaseStationC.nc, BaseStationP.nc
+++++Added Timer0 and code to turn radio ON and OFF at specific times
